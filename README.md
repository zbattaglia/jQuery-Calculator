# Server Side Calculator

## Description

_Duration: 2 Days_

The purpose of this project was to create a calulator app that allowed the user to input two numbers and perform a mathematical operation (+, -, *, /) on them. An interface resembling a real calculator was created to allow for intuitive operation by a user. The history of calculations ran is displayed on the DOM for reference.

This project was used to learn more about setting up a server and client, making GET, POST, and delete requests/response, updating the DOM, and working with functions and Objects. A greater understanding of styling with CSS and Bootstrap was developed to make an intuitive user interface.
